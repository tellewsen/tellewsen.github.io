I used to work at <a target="_blank" href="https://uio.no">University of Oslo</a>.</p> <p>My specialty is backend programming using python. I have written services that handle storing,
		serving and transferring, personal and financial information using a wide range of designs.</p> <p>For database access I have done both the old school approach of writing raw SQL, as well as
		using ORMs like Django and SQLAlchemy. While the former can be really nice when you know
		precisely what you want, I'd take the ORM approach every time.</p> <p>I've set up REST apis using Flask and FastAPi, serving them using Gunicorn and Uvicorn. Both are
		perfectly fine.</p> <p>I prefer using pytest for unit testing over the unittest library, simply because of the number
		of characters needed for assertions.</p> <p>I know how to make a frontend using the Django templating system, but I prefer the split
		approach with the backend serving an API using Django-rest-framework, and the frontend written
		in React.js.</p> <p>Speaking of frontend, I know how to write one using typescript with React.js and some of the
		regular libraries typically used.</p></div>`,1);function h(e){var t=o();r(2),n(e,t)}export{h as component};
