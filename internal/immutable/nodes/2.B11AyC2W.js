			with utilities I need from time to time, and a few for learning new tricks in the frontend
			space. If you end up going here often and I'm missing something simple, shoot me a message
			somewhere and I'll add it.</p> <h2>About me</h2> <p>I'm <strong>Andreas Ellewsen</strong>, a software developer with a background in astrophysics
			and a passion for building elegant, reliable systems.</p> <p>I earned my <strong>Master of Science in Astronomy</strong> from the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://uio.no">University of Oslo</a></strong> in 2018, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, scientific computing, and problem-solving.
			After graduating, I joined the University of Oslo as a <strong>software developer</strong>, where I spent over five years building internal tools,
			streamlining integrations, and supporting academic and administrative systems. Since 2024,
			I've continued my developer journey at <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://itera.com">Itera</a></strong>, focusing on crafting
			efficient, scalable solutions in a professional consulting environment.</p> <p>I have experience building <strong>robust backend systems in Python</strong>, and developing <strong>modern frontend interfaces using React and Svelte</strong>. I enjoy turning complex
			challenges into clean, functional software. Whether that's backend architecture, API
			integration, or full-stack development doesn't really matter. My approach blends scientific
			thinking with practical engineering, and I'm always looking for smart ways to make technology
			work better for people.</p> <p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new video games or tinkering with
			personal coding projects (like this one) for fun.</p> <p class="disclaimer svelte-12n0f4y">Yes, all of that is a summary of me, made by an LLM, in a generic consultant tone that may
			make you nauseous.</p></div></main>`);function l(e){var n=a();o(e,n)}export{l as component};
