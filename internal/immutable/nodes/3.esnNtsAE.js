			astrophysics and a passion for building elegant, reliable systems.</p> <p class="svelte-g8dg0v">I earned my <strong>Master of Science in Astronomy</strong> from the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://uio.no">University of Oslo</a></strong> in 2018, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, scientific computing, and problem-solving.
			After graduating, I joined the University of Oslo as a <strong>software developer</strong>, where I spent over five years building internal tools,
			streamlining integrations, and supporting academic and administrative systems. Since 2024,
			I've continued my developer journey at <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://itera.com">Itera</a></strong>, focusing on crafting
			efficient, scalable solutions in a professional consulting environment.</p> <p class="svelte-g8dg0v">I have experience building <strong>robust backend systems in Python</strong>, and developing <strong>modern frontend interfaces using React and Svelte</strong>. I enjoy turning complex
			challenges into clean, functional softwareâ€”whether that's backend architecture, API
			integration, or full-stack development. My approach blends scientific thinking with practical
			engineering, and I'm always looking for smart ways to make technology work better for people.</p> <p class="svelte-g8dg0v">When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new games or tinkering with personal
			coding projects for fun.</p> <p class="disclaimer svelte-g8dg0v">Yes, all of that is a ChatGPT summary of me in a generic consultant tone that may make you
			nauseous.</p></div></main>`);function l(e){var n=o();a(e,n)}export{l as component};
