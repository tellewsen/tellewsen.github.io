		astrophysics and a passion for building elegant, reliable systems.</p> <div><p class="svelte-g8dg0v">I am a software developer currently working at</p> <p class="svelte-g8dg0v">My specialty is backend programming using python. Mostly to make integrations between
			different systems. I have also written services that handle storing, serving and transferring,
			personal and financial information using a wide range of designs.</p> <p class="svelte-g8dg0v">I also know how to make websites using typescript with React.js and some of the regular
			libraries typically used. As you can see, this site is written in Svelte so that works too.</p> <p class="svelte-g8dg0v">I earned my <strong>Master of Science in Astronomy</strong> from the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://uio.no">University of Oslo</a></strong> in 2018, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, scientific computing, and problem-solving.
			After graduating, I joined the University of Oslo as a <strong>software developer</strong>, where I spent over five years building internal tools,
			streamlining integrations, and supporting academic and administrative systems. Since 2024,
			I've continued my developer journey at <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://itera.com">Itera</a></strong>, focusing on crafting
			efficient, scalable solutions in a professional consulting environment.</p> <p class="svelte-g8dg0v">I have experience building <strong>robust backend systems in Python</strong>, and developing <strong>modern frontend interfaces using React and Svelte</strong>. I enjoy turning complex
			challenges into clean, functional softwareâ€”whether that's backend architecture, API
			integration, or full-stack development. My approach blends scientific thinking with practical
			engineering, and I'm always looking for smart ways to make technology work better for people.</p> <p class="svelte-g8dg0v">When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new games or tinkering with personal
			coding projects for fun.</p> <p class="disclaimer svelte-g8dg0v">Yes, all of that is a ChatGPT summary of me in a generic consultant summary.</p></div></main>`);function l(e){var n=a();s(e,n)}export{l as component};
