<div>
	The site got a <a href="/utils/qr">QR code generator</a> yesterday. However, pretty much everyone wants
	to stuff a logo or something in their codes, so now you can do that here as well. At the moment it's
	quite stupid, so if you upload something with transparent parts you're going to get something ugly.
