	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<div>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm <strong>Andreas Ellewsen</strong>, a software developer with a background in
			astrophysics and a passion for building elegant, reliable systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			I earned my <strong>Master of Science in Astronomy</strong> from the
			<strong><a target="_blank" href="https://uio.no">University of Oslo</a></strong>
			in 2018, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis, scientific computing, and problem-solving.
			After graduating, I joined the University of Oslo as a
			<strong>software developer</strong>, where I spent over five years building internal tools,
			streamlining integrations, and supporting academic and administrative systems. Since 2024,
			I've continued my developer journey at
			<strong><a target="_blank" href="https://itera.com">Itera</a></strong>, focusing on crafting
			efficient, scalable solutions in a professional consulting environment.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have experience building <strong>robust backend systems in Python</strong>, and developing
			<strong>modern frontend interfaces using React and Svelte</strong>. I enjoy turning complex
			challenges into clean, functional softwareâ€”whether that's backend architecture, API
			integration, or full-stack development. My approach blends scientific thinking with practical
			engineering, and I'm always looking for smart ways to make technology work better for people.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring new games or tinkering with personal
			coding projects for fun.
		</p>

		<p class="disclaimer">
			Yes, all of that is a ChatGPT summary of me in a generic consultant tone that may make you
			nauseous.
