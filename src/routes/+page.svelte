		Welcome to the site. As you can see this site is pretty barren, and that's the way I like it.
		The most interesting thing as of now is probably the utilities page. I use this page to test new
		javascript frameworks. The current iteration of the site is written in <a
			href="https://svelte.dev/"
			target="_blank">Svelte</a
		> as a client side only page so that it can be hosted for free using Github Pages.
